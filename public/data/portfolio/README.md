# Portfolio Text Content

This folder contains text files for all portfolio projects.

## File Structure

For each project (1-10), there are 3 text files:

- `title-project1.txt` - The project title
- `description-project1.txt` - Short description (shown on portfolio grid)
- `detailed-description-project1.txt` - Full description (shown on project detail page)

## How to Update Content

1. Open the text file you want to edit
2. Replace the placeholder text with your actual content
3. Save the file
4. Run the update script or let me know to sync the changes to the website

## Current Files

**Project 1:**
- title-project1.txt
- description-project1.txt
- detailed-description-project1.txt

**Project 2:**
- title-project2.txt
- description-project2.txt

... and so on for Projects 3-10

## Tips

- Keep titles concise (2-5 words)
- Short descriptions should be 1-2 sentences
- Detailed descriptions can be multiple paragraphs
- Use plain text only (no special formatting)
